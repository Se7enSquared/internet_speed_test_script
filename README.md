# internet_speed_test_script
Internet Speed Test is a script that pulls your internet upload and download speed at 1 hour intervals and writes the data to a csv file for analysis. 

I created this because I suspected that my ISP was not providing the speeds I am paying for and I wanted proof.

this script relies on the speed-test module found here: https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/
